## 0.12.0 (2024-11-22)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Yet another breaking changes. See release notes or changelog before upgrading.

### BREAKING CHANGES
- Option `twigPrintWidth` has been removed

I don't see any reason why we should keep the option `twigPrintWidth`. Prettier provide mechanism to use different `printWidth` for different file types by using _override_ (see example below).

__What to do?__

Remove `twigPrintWidth` from your prettier config and use [override](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html#configuration-overrides) instead.

__Example__
```diff
  # ./.prettierrc.yaml
- twigPrintWidth: 120
+ overrides:
+   - files: "*.twig"
+     options:
+       printWidth: 120
```

### Features
- Add support for spread operator

__Example__
```twig
<twig:Component {{ ...vars }} />

{% set numbers = [1, 2, ...moreNumbers] %}
{% set ratings = {'q1': 10, 'q2': 5, ...moreRatings} %}

{{ 'Hello %s %s!'|format(...['Fabien', 'Potencier']) }}
```

### Bugfixes
- Make sure that empty block statement will have empty line in between for consistency

---
## 0.11.1 (2024-11-13)

### Bugfixes
- Fix handling empty string as default value on macros declaration

---
## 0.11.0 (2024-11-12)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Twig coding standard has been updated to version 3.x. This contains BREAKING CHANGES.

### BREAKING CHANGES
This release contains breaking changes, check your setup before upgrading.
Option `twigFollowOfficialCodingStandards` is set to `true` by default. If you're
using twig version _3.11_ or older it will break your setup. Notable changes on
twig coding standard on version 3.x is added support for using colon `:` as separator
for argument names and values (which is enabled by default with this plugin).

__Example__
```twig
{# Input #}
{{ data|convert_encoding(from= 'iso-2022-jp', to: 'UTF-8') }}

{# Before #}
{{ data|convert_encoding(from = 'iso-2022-jp', to = 'UTF-8') }}

{# After #}
{{ data|convert_encoding(from: 'iso-2022-jp', to: 'UTF-8') }}
```

__What to do?__
- If you want to upgrade this plugin, make sure that you're using twig version 3.12 or later
- If you want to keep using older version of twig, you can set option `twigFollowOfficialCodingStandards` to false (your code style might become inconsistent)

### Features
